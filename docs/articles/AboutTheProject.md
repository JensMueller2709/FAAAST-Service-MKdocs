# About the Project
The Reference Architecture of Industrie 4.0 (RAMI) presents the [Asset Administration Shell (AAS)](https://www.plattform-i40.de/SiteGlobals/IP/Forms/Listen/Downloads/EN/Downloads_Formular.html?cl2Categories_TechnologieAnwendungsbereich_name=Verwaltungsschale) as the basis for interoperability. AAS is the digital representation of an asset that is able to provide information about this asset, i.e. information about properties, functionality, parameters, documentation, etc.. The AAS operates as Digital Twin of the asset it represents.
Furthermore, the AAS covers all stages of the lifecycle of an asset starting in the development phase, reaching the most importance in the operation phase and finally delivering valuable information for the decline/decomposition phase.

To guarantee the interoperability of assets Industie 4.0 defines an information metamodel for the AAS covering all important aspects as type/instance concept, events, redefined data specification templates, security aspects, mapping of data formats and many more. Moreover interfaces and operations for a registry, a repository, publish and discovery are specified.
At first glance the evolving specification of the AAS seems pretty complex and a challenging task for asset providers. To make things easier to FAÂ³ST provides an implementation of several tools to allow easy and fast creation and management of AAS-compliant Digital Twins.

-   [Details of the Asset Administration Shell - Part 1](https://www.plattform-i40.de/IP/Redaktion/EN/Downloads/Publikation/Details_of_the_Asset_Administration_Shell_Part1_V3.html), Nov 2021 <br />
The publication states how companies can use the Asset Administration Shell to compile and structure information. In this way all information can be shared as a package (set of files) with partners at several levels of the value chain. It is not necessary to provide online access to this data from the very beginning.

This part extends Part 1 and defines how information provided in the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) (e.g. submodels or properties) can be accessed dynamically via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).
